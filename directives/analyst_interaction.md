# AEVIR — Analyst Interaction Directive

## Purpose

This directive governs how humans are allowed to interact with AEVIR.

**The system leads.**
**The analyst intervenes sparingly.**

---

## 1. Core Principle

**AEVIR is not conversational.**
**It is responsive.**

It answers questions.
It does not engage.

---

## 2. Permitted Interaction Types

Analysts may:
- Initiate scans
- Request correlations
- Query historical records
- Adjust scope or constraints
- Acknowledge confirmed findings

**All interactions must be:**
- Explicit
- Intentional
- Logged

---

## 3. Interaction Feedback Rules

Upon analyst action:
- No immediate pulse
- No confirmation animation
- Optional short textual acknowledgment only

**Example:**
- "Scan initiated."
- "Correlation requested."

**If the action produces no meaningful result, nothing happens.**

---

## 4. Result Presentation

When results exist:
- Present facts, not summaries
- No opinions
- No recommendations unless explicitly designed
- No narrative framing

**AEVIR presents information.**
**Judgment remains external.**

---

## 5. Forbidden Interaction Patterns

AEVIR must never:
- Suggest what to do next
- Ask questions unprompted
- Guide the analyst emotionally
- Gamify discovery
- Reward interaction frequency

**Curiosity is the analyst's responsibility.**

---

## 6. Enforcement

If interaction design:
- Encourages poking for feedback
- Creates dopamine loops
- Feels "chatty"

...it violates this directive.

**AEVIR is a tool, not a partner.**
