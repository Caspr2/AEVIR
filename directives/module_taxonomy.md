# AEVIR — Module Taxonomy Directive

## Purpose

This directive defines the canonical conceptual modules within AEVIR and their semantic boundaries.

**Modules describe what the system is doing, not how it looks.**

---

## 1. Core Modules (Locked)

### 1.1 SIGNALS

**Definition**
Raw observations ingested from sources.

**Characteristics:**
- Uninterpreted
- Time-stamped
- Source-bound

**Signals do not imply meaning.**

---

### 1.2 ECHOES

**Definition**
Signals that match or resemble historical data.

**Characteristics:**
- Temporal comparison
- Pattern recurrence
- Historical alignment

**Echoes imply memory, not certainty.**

---

### 1.3 HORIZONS

**Definition**
Projected implications derived from correlations.

**Characteristics:**
- Forward-looking
- Probabilistic
- Non-assertive

**Horizons suggest possibility, never prediction certainty.**

---

### 1.4 NODES (Optional / Structural)

**Definition**
Entities or endpoints through which signals pass.

**Characteristics:**
- Structural, not semantic
- No pulse authority
- Support role only

---

## 2. Module Interaction Rules

- Signals feed Echoes
- Echoes inform Horizons
- Horizons never generate Signals
- Modules do not self-announce

**Only confirmed cross-module understanding may trigger a pulse.**

---

## 3. Naming Discipline

- Module names are singular and capitalized
- No synonyms introduced in UI
- No marketing reinterpretations

**These names are part of the system language.**

---

## 4. Enforcement

If a feature:
- Blurs module boundaries
- Renames concepts for presentation
- Adds narrative framing

...it violates this directive.

**AEVIR is precise by design.**
